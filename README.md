### Idea ðŸ’¬

* Now I kinda wonder how the **WikiHow** and **BigPatent** dataset for abstractive summarisation are generated. If its not people annotated dataset, there is possiblity to come up with our own interesting dataset. (too ambitious but this is just for fun dreaming). Blog Posts from [Medium] - I'm sure every data sceince student have come across that, is an interesting sourse of articles where different writers have all their own styles. And the content is well-organised too. Unlike document from Wiki and Patent documentations, there is more variety in writing style and content! So if we could crawl data from Medium and generate summarisation, this would be another valuable dataset!

article: For this type of thong, you will need a piece of fabric about 10 inches by 12 inches that is somewhat stretchy. You'll also need some elastic for the waistband and leg holes in your thong. Pick a color you want to match your fabric because this elastic will show. If you find that elastic is uncomfortable, you can always try substituting it for some stretchy lace, although it may not attach quite as well to your underwear.  Before you cut your fabric, you'll want to create a pattern for your thong that feels most comfortable to you. A good starting point is to cut a triangle out of a piece of paper with the two longest sides at 9 inches and the top, shortest side at 7.25 inches. Hold the triangle up to yourself and decide if it needs to be bigger or smaller, and then cut it to fit the dimensions you would like for your thong.When making your thong, the tip of the triangle should point down, so cut your fabric with that in mind.  Once you have decided on the dimensions for the pattern for your thong, lay the paper pattern over your fabric, trace a triangle onto your fabric, and then cut it out. If you are using a very stretchy fabric you can cut the exact dimensions of the pattern, but if your fabric has only a little stretch to it you may want to cut a slightly bigger piece so you have more fabric to work with. , You will need elastic for the waistband, the back of your thong, and for the two sides of your thong. The elastic for the sides should be one inch shorter than the side length of the triangle (you will stretch it as you sew) and the piece for the back should be about 8 inches, but you can adjust for your comfort.  Elastic for the waistband needs to be about one inch shorter than your hips or waist measurement, depending on where you plan to wear your thong. Use a measuring tape to measure waist or hips, and then cut a piece of elastic one inch less than that measurement.   Depending on where you want your thong to sit will determine if you use your hip or waist measurements, and will also determine the length of your back elastic. If you want a higher thong, you'll need more back elastic and less elastic for your waistband, but if you want your thong to sit on your hips you'll likely need more elastic for the waistband and less for the back elastic.  Take your elastic and place it on top of your fabric at the edge, on the two longest sides of your thong (the sides that point downwards to make a V). Then, place a pin at the top of the side elastic and one at the bottom. You'll then want a pin in the middle of the fabric, so pull the fabric from both sides to stretch it out, and place a pin in the elastic towards the middle, while fabric is still stretched. When you let the fabric go your fabric may crumple up a bit, but once you sew the elastic into it and put it on, it will stretch to fit.  Once you have finished pinning, using a stretch stitch or a zigzag stitch, sew along the elastic, pulling and stretching the fabric as you go so that it lines up evenly.  After you have sewn the elastic to the sides of your fabric, you'll want to connect your back elastic to the front of the thong by attaching one end of the back elastic to the bottom point of your triangle, and sewing a small seam, making sure the elastic is in the back of the fabric.  Before you sew your waistband to your thong, you'll want to sew the ends together, making a nice circle with your waistband. Then, sew the loose end of the back elastic to the waistband, making sure the back elastic is inside the waistband. , Fold the waistband in half, with the back elastic resting on the fold of the waistband. The opposite fold will be the center of your thong -- place a pin there. Then, take the center of the top of your triangle and line it up with that pin, connecting it with another pin. Your elastic waistband should be on top of your triangle fabric, to match the sides of the triangle.  Sew along the elastic, connecting the waistband to the top of the triangle fabric and making sure to stretch the fabric as you go. Then, cut any extra threads and try your thong on, admiring your finished product!

article: Scientists and meteorite enthusiasts keep up to date records of where they find meteorites. You can look online for databases, such as the Meteoritical Society’s database, that show the areas that produce the most meteorite discoveries. Pinpointing the nearest “hot spot” for meteorites is a great start to finding your own., Moisture and damp climates will deteriorate a meteorite relatively quickly. Your best shot at finding an intact meteorite is to look in a place that stays hot and dry. Deserts are one of the best climates to search. Dried up lake beds are great, too.For example, the more meteorites have been found in the Sahara than any other place on Earth.  Before you take off scouring the Earth in search of meteorites, take a moment to think about who owns the land you are searching. If the land is owned privately, you will need to owner’s permission before searching it. Public lands follow different rules depending on the particular jurisdiction, but you always need permission to search any public lands.If it is privately owned land, you need the permission of the land owner. If the land is publicly owned (e.g. a park) you need permission the governing body to search it, and permission the keep the meteorite if you find it. Some areas classify them as artifacts, meaning that they belong to the municipality rather than the discoverer.  While the name might suggest something exotic, a meteorite stick is a simple stick with a magnet at the end of it. You can stick the end to rocks on the ground to test for magnetic properties. If a rock has magnetic properties, then there’s a chance that it could be a meteorite and warrants further investigation.The stick also doubles as a way to swat away things like snakes.  You should get a metal detector that is made to search for gold. These are the most accurate metal detectors. Go to the location that you intend to search and run the coil of the metal detector along the ground to scan for meteorites underneath the surface.Good, used metal detectors generally cost between $250 and $400. There is no need to buy a new one for a higher price. The metal detector is more sensitive than a meteorite stick, but less convenient to use. You should keep both with you.  A GPS will serve you in two ways. First, it will help you keep track of your position in case you get lost. Second, it allows you to mark the location of any meteorites that you find.If you do find a meteorite, marking its location is important. This allows you to upload it to the meteorite databases and help map the location of meteorites.  Sometimes, you can find meteorites just lying on the ground. Other times, your metal detector will pick up a signal from something deep in the ground. Bring along a pickaxe and a spade to help you dig up any potential meteorites., Testing the rock for magnetic properties can be done rather quickly. Just hold a magnet near the rock to determine if there is any interaction. This can even be done with the magnet at the tip of your meteorite stick. Most meteorites have magnetic properties.Keep in mind that some terrestrial rocks also have magnetic properties.  Because of their high iron and nickel content, meteorites are rather dense. They are often denser than most terrestrial rocks. This can be loosely translated to being heavier than other rocks their size. Pick up the rock and analyze how heavy it feels versus what you would expect a rock that size to feel like., While not all meteorites share the same characteristics, there are some common traits that can be found in most of them. If you can identify one or more of these traits, there’s a good chance that you have a found a meteorite. Four specific traits to look for are:A metallic shine on the surface of the rock Small rounded pieces of stones on the surface (these are known as chondrules) A black or brown coating known as fusion crust (this is produced by the extreme heat of flying through the atmosphere) Small dents covering the surface of the rock (this is regmaglypt texture or thumbprints)  , Try dragging the rock in question across a streak plate or a piece of paper. If it leaves a streak, it is probably a terrestrial rock. If it doesn’t leave a streak, it might be a meteorite.

If the inside of the bowl is dirty, you know that you carburetor inside are likely to be as well.  It is held in by the pin, that can be pushed through and the float will lift out. You can see at this point if the float isn't moving freely you could have a sticky float resulting in excessive flooding of the engine. Make sure this is working freely on re-install.  first you can remove the high speed jet (the one with the slot on top). It is removed with a flat screwdriver. Once removed you can look at it against a light and see if it is clogged or not. If this is you can soak it for a minute in engine degreaser and then hit it with compressed air to blast out the debris. This may need to be done a few times until fully clear of dirt. Once clean, re-install make sure not to tighten excessively.  It is usually the one sticking up higher, and usually a hex headed 1/4" brass jet.urn it out of the carb and inspect for a clogged passage. You can soak it in degreaser and blast it with compressed air as well. Repeat that to make sure it is cleaned right out. Look down the passage where the main jet came from and blast air down to clean it out as well. Now you can re-install the main jet.  Remove linkage and lubricate to help in ease of operation. Clean intake of carburetor so no debris gets into the engine.  Do all the jets, intake ports, idle ports, overflow ports and where ever you can blow the air. Blow the hole carb out to loosen and remove all the tiny particles of debris.  You can soak the bowl in some degreaser to loosen some stuck on dirt. Be sure to wipe and clean all dirt at this stage so that no more gets inside. This will later help in less problems with clogged up internals.  Now you can make sure that your pin is lubed with WD or whichever you choose to make that float operation smoother. Just a little spray on the pin and where it meets the float will help so much. Push the pin through the post coming from the carburetor and through the float mount and back through the other side post. No need to fasten it there because once the bowl is installed it will hold it all together.  Once re-installed check final operation of the choke and blow last bits of dirt away. You can also hear the float moving if you shake it easily. Once all clean you can install you fuel lines and vent hoses and its all ready for re-installation on the vehicle!

article: This task will vary from car to car, but typically you will have to remove some screws around the middle of the panel (such as inside the door pull) and then use a prying tool around the outside to pop out the clips on the perimeter.Sometimes you may have to remove things such as weather-stripping or door moldings as well.  Attach the probes of your multi-meter to the motor’s plug and toggle the switch up and down.Make note of the voltage in both directions. Your owner’s manual should list the specific voltage required.  There should be no slow spots or blockages., If you the motor is getting the proper voltage but not functioning properly, you likely need to replace it. Start by unplugging the wiring connectors from the motor.  If your motor is functioning properly but the window is not responding, you may need to replace your regulator.  The regulator is the lift assembly that moves your window up and down. You will have to move the window up or down to align these bolts with a hole in the door interior. Using an extension on a ratchet, you will put a socket (usually 8 or 10 mm) through the hole and loosen the two bolts., Use your hands to push the window up, and then either fasten it with tape or pull it out of the door altogether., You will have to press down on the clip that holds the wiring harness into place and pull the harness out. These can be hard to press and sometimes it is best if you can get a screwdriver on it to press it in., Any bolts holding the harness and motor will have to be removed.  These can often be difficult to bolts to remove. You may need to use a ratchet with a long extension to provide the necessary angle to access and turn the bolts.  Once you have the assembly removed, you can separate the two pieces and replace the one that is malfunctioning., Once you have replaced the malfunctioning part, whether it was the motor or the regulator, it is time to slide the assembly back into the door's interior and bolt it back into it's original position., Plug the wiring harness into the window motor. This will provide power to the motor so use caution., Remove the tape or re-install your window. Make sure that the tabs in the bottom of the window are properly aligned to bolt it back onto the regulator., Using the bolts you removed earlier and the same extension, you need to bolt your window back to the regulator., It should now move up and down freely when you press the switch.

Just watch or listen to something different,and see if you like it. If you are looking for someone else, this may be the way to go about it.; , Look up facts on them, visit a fan club site, look at pictures of them. Get to know their history - their career - anything that hints at who they are and what they've done.  You could do such things such as listening to their music or watching one of their films. Or, if you prefer to be really creative, how about making a fan book about them? Get a good quality notebook, write about them, stick in images or notes, whatever to make your book special.  Put them up on your bedroom wall so you can look at them whenever you like. Or, if you reckon you're a good at drawing, you could have a go at drawing a picture of them! Do so carefully. Put it up in your room, and when people see they can know how much you love the celebrity!  , Don't worry if they have never heard of him or don't like him/her that much, just because she/he is not the most popular celeb on the street, that you like him is the only thing that matters!  , Write to their fan mail address and write a bit about yourself and why you like their work so much. However, be careful not to be tempted to scribble 'I love you! You're so hot! Will you marry me?' all over the page as it may seem a bit over the top to them.

article: Curtains and blinds are a great way to prevent lurking criminals from looking inside your house to see what you have. Keep all of your windows covered when you are not home, especially the ones facing the street.Since it is very easy to see inside windows when the lights are on and it is dark outside, make sure to keep them covered when you are home at night.  Try to avoid placing valuable items like TVs, stereos, jewelry, game systems, and other valuables in front of windows, or in the window’s direct line of sight. Instead, place them against the wall or off to the side. If a criminal cannot determine what kind of valuable items you have, then they are less likely to break in.Additionally, make sure to cut up the delivery boxes of expensive items. Place the pieces in a trash bag and throw it away. This will prevent a lurking thief from seeing what kind of valuable items you own.  Even if it is a basic alarm system, you should install one. Plus, many insurance companies cover home alarm systems. Contact yours to see which alarm systems are covered. ADT, Frontpoint, and Link Interactive offer great deals on home alarm systems.You can also find home alarm systems at your local hardware store. Alarm systems give homeowners piece of mind when they are away from home, as well as while they sleeping at night.  Install deadbolt locks on your doors and keep them locked at all times. If you have a wooden doorframe, then use strike plates and heavy-duty screws to prevent your door form being kicked in. Because they are very easy to open, avoid pushbutton locks on your doors.Alternatively, you can install an ANSI grade 1 lock if you do not want to install deadbolt locks. To secure sliding glass doors, install a latch or a track blocker to prevent burglars from opening them easily. If you have an older sliding glass door, then install an anti-lift device as well.  Make sure your windows have latches and keep them locked at all times, especially bottom story windows. Like doors, you can also install blocking devices onto your windows for added security.If you can, try to purchase windows that are made out of laminated or tempered glass. These types of glass are much stronger than the glass used to make traditional windows.  Criminals are well aware of hiding spots for spare keys, like under the front door’s mat, or inside flowerpots and mailboxes. Instead, have a trusted neighbor, friend, or family member hold your spare key for you.

article: Fix their relative height and distance so that you can sit comfortably. Don’t set your seat so far back that you have to lean forward to grip the steering wheel. Avoid placing undue stress on your body, which may tire you out and distract you, making you less responsive.The positioning of your seat may effect which grip you find more comfortable: 9-and-3 or 10-and-2. Taller people, for instance, may find 10-and-2 most comfortable, due to the limits of how much they can adjust either the steering column or their seat.  Extend your sights at least a half-mile to a mile farther up the road. Keep your eyes peeled for any curves, hazards, or other factors that may necessitate a change in direction. Anticipate when you need to turn early on. Give yourself as much time as possible to plan and execute changes in direction.If you are passing through a tight curve that significantly reduces your field of vision, always focus on the farthest point that you can see ahead of you. Trust your peripheral vision to alert you to sudden changes that appear closer to hand.  Anticipate that a change in direction at slow speed will require greater physical effort with the steering wheel. Be prepared to turn it by a greater number of degrees in low-speed areas like parking lots, residential streets, and urban neighborhoods. Conversely, keep your turning actions with the wheel very, very slight when driving fast. Expect a slight turn of the wheel to cause a very pronounced change of direction on high-speed roads like highways., Turning the steering wheel when the car is parked or otherwise at rest can have adverse effects on your tires and power-steering. Do so when necessary, such as when you parallel-park or execute a K-turn. Otherwise, try to avoid it., Maintain optimum control over the vehicle while using tools other than the steering wheel. Use your nearest hand to operate such functions as turn signals and gear shifts while driving. Keep your other hand where it is as you do so. Don’t risk letting go of the wheel to alter its position.

article: Throw it firmly from hand to hand, smacking it into a ball shape.  This will help the ball of clay adhere to the wheel once it starts spinning. The last thing you want is a ball of wet clay flying across the room.  Place a bucket of water where you can easily reach it to wet your hands while you work.  Throw down the ball of clay as close to the center of the wheel as you can, then press it down into a conical shape.  As you build up speed, wet the clay, and with one hand on the side of the clay lump, and the other side on top of it, ease the clump towards the middle. Use the upper hand to keep the clay from flying out of control.          You can tell the clay is centered when it no longer looks like it's wobbling, but sitting stationary in the center of the spinning wheel. Don't stop spinning.  Then work the clay into a cone, then press it down into a thick disk. Repeat this step a couple times. This is known as "wheel wedging" and helps to condition the clay. Make sure you keep the clay centered as you work. , Continue working the hole, using a hand on the outside of the clay to shape your pot.  Gradually pull the clay up with even pressure, until it's the desired height.  If you want it a bit wider at the neck, just pull back with your inside fingers. Don't do it too hard.  Wet the wheel (not the pot) and using a stiff wire or fishing line, and holding it with both hands, pull it from the back of the pot towards you until the pot is separate from the wheel.

Turn the cranks a couple of times while holding the rag around the chain firmly. This works best if you hold the upper portion of the chain, the one that's closest to the saddle (seat). You will notice that the chain becomes much cleaner.           Mark one link with a magic marker, sticker or a piece of tape, so that you know where you started. Starting with the marked link, apply one drop of chain lube to each link. It's best to apply a little drop to each gap where two links overlap. Don't use too much or it will be wasted because you'll wipe off the excess lube anyway!  , When you've lubed all the links, turn the cranks again for half a minute or so to make sure that the lube settles properly into the inside of the link. ,

article: No I do not mean brand, I mean music bands. Scarlet has shirts with underground bands on them like Deathcab for Cutie, The Killers, and All Time Low. A good place to get these cheaply are online or thrift stores, but if you're willing to shell out some cash, you can go to the concerts as well.; , They are cute and interesting and make your T-shirts from being obscene. you might also want to wear them just in case you spontaneously decide to go swimming with a hot popular senior ;).  Remember the only color you wear is in your cami. But don't go overboard or punk e.g. ripping your clothes and pinning them with diaper pins or imitating Pink. Remember Scarlet's outfits are a mix of burlesque and dark wave. Burlesque does not mean slutty, it means sexy and ladylike to a point. Wear lacy camisoles, tight-fitting shirts, and ruffled skirts.  cocktail rings are a must! Make them glittery and loud. Also wear crosses and intricate necklaces around your neck (a fairy pendant gold chain or an unusually braided silver necklace with a cross).  If you want to wear foundation, choose the pale kind since the book mentions that Scarlet is naturally pale. A little bit of eyeshadow is okay, but don't go overboard you are not trying to be Bozo the clown.

article: The tabla consists of two separate wooden drums, one smaller and one larger. The smaller drum, positioned on the right, is called the daylan (or tabla) and the larger drum, positioned on the left, is called the baylan.Each drum makes a different tone but together they make the distinctive sound we associate with the tabla, a sound that is central to classical Indian music.; , In order to play this drum well and keep your instrument in good working condition, it is important to understand how it is made. The daylan is made of wood, usually from a Neem or Shisham tree. The baylan is made out of metal or clay.The two drums are made of different materials so that each has a distinct sound all its own.          Both drums are covered with a goatskin drum heads. The drum heads are attached to the drum with long leather strips that attach to a leather ring at the bottom of the drum. In order to tune the drum, tabla makers insert wooden blocks between the drum body and the leather strips. Moving the wooden blocks up and down along the drum adjusts the tightness of the drum head and tone of the drum. An element that is unique to the tabla is the application of the sinai, a patch of iron fillings mixed with rice paste applied to the surface of the drum, right on the goat hide, which allows for further tuning of the drums., Before starting to play, you need to learn how to position your body correctly, as posture and body position are very important to playing the tabla.          Sit cross legged on the ground. This will position your body on the same level as your tabla. Place the drums in front of you, close enough to almost touch your legs, with the space between the drums right at the center of your body. The larger drum, on your left, should sit flat, with the top of the drum facing straight up. The face of the smaller drum, on your right, should be facing away from you, at approximately 35 degrees.The position of your waist should straight. Keep your posture upright. You should put one hand on each drum. Make sure that each of your hands can comfortably reach the drums in front of them. The placement of both hands should not be stiff. It should be in comfortable position, so that playing tabla is easy.  The three fingers starting from the right of your hand, your middle finger, ring finger and little finger, should be positioned on the sinai at the center of the drum.          Make sure that your index finger is raised up away from the head of the drum just a little bit.Rest the heel of your hand on the edge of the drum.  Keep your contact with the drum centered on the sinai at the center of the drum head.          Lift your hand just a few inches and then bring down your middle, ring, and little fingers onto the center of the drum. This is a stroke called Te.Lift your hand just a few inches and then bring down just your pointer finger into the very center of the sinai. This is a stroke called Teh., Place the palm of your hand on the drum, so that your hand covers up the syahi and your elbow is bent. If you are in the correct position the heel of your hand will be just covering the syahi and your forearm will be resting on the edge of the drum.          The sinai on the baylan is positioned off center. Make sure your drum is positioned so that the sinai is at about 2 o'clock, if the top of the drum was a clock. This makes it comfortable for your palm to cover it and your forearm to rest on the edge of the drum.  Keep your forearm resting on the drum and simply lift your hand up, flexing at the wrist, and bring it down gently. This stroke is called Ke.  Each word in a bol stands in for a sound you make on the drum, for example the strokes Te and Teh that you have already learned. A series of these words will create a bol.  While practicing, keep the rhythm slow so that you can focus on hitting the drum and combining sounds correctly.          Don't try to practice more than one tabla bol at a time. Repeat the practice of same bol at least one hour a day. While practicing, avoid talking with others. Concentrate on tabla playing.  Your goal should be to increase speed but not at the expense of losing accuracy.  Once you have mastered the basics of the tabla, feel free to experiment with your own style. For example, use the force of index finger on the edge of tabla to create a nice tone.

article: Use a unique skill or ability that you already possess and make it appear more impressive. Maybe you have great drumming skills, a stellar singing voice, or the ability to make complicated balloon animals. You can then take your ability to the next level by adding in a surprising or interesting element. Think of creative ways to impress the judges with your talent and show them how well you can do the talent even in less than ideal circumstances.You may want to enlist friends to perform with you and create an act where you all drum together on stage. Or you may ask friends who can play instruments to be your backing band for your singing performance. You can then create synchronized movements as a band that you perform together during the act. If you have a more specialized talent, like making balloon animals or juggling, you may want to add in an element of difficulty that will appear impressive to the judges. This could be making a huge balloon animal within a certain time limit or making balloon animals while riding a unicycle or running on a treadmill.; , When you are creating your act, you should showcase your strengths as a performer. This will help you feel more comfortable when you perform and more confident. You will also be at your best when you are catering to your strengths, as this can help to hide your weaknesses as a performer.If you are more comfortable in costume when performing in front of others, come up with a unique costume that ties into your act. Maybe you wear an updated clown costume for your juggling act or a long, glamorous gown for your jazz singing performance with a band. Think about how you can use costume as a way to feel comfortable and confident on stage. You may be at ease when you move and dance around the stage, as opposed to staying in one place. Integrate this into your act, where you do a coordinated dance with the other people in your act or do a dance to fit your act if you are on stage alone.  Stage props can be as simple as a microphone stand or as complex as confetti raining down from the rafters of the theater. Think of ways that you can use stage props to enhance your performance. Maybe you use an umbrella in your dancing act to add an element of originality and surprise. Or maybe you integrate the mic stand into your balloon animals act.   Stage props like confetti, balloons, pyrotechnics, and lasers can all be costly and complicated to set up. If you have the budget and the time to integrate these props, do so as long as they fit within in your act and are not simply being used to fill time or space on the stage. Avoid leaning on the props to hide your lack of talent. Your talent should always be at the forefront.  Audience participation is always a good thing in any performance. Often, appealing to your audience will help to get them on your side and impress the judges. Think of ways to involve the audience. This may mean asking someone from the audience to participate in your act or have the audience snap or clap along to your performance., Appeal to the crowd and the judges by using body language that is engaging and fun to watch. This means making eye contact with the audience, smiling at the audience, and putting your body into your performance. Use expansive gestures and movements if you are doing a dance routine or performing with a band. Demonstrate energy and enthusiasm towards the audience, as this will make the audience feel more engaged during your act., Facial expressions are a key element of performance, especially if you are a singer or a dancer. Practice an open expression by keeping your eyes wide and open as you perform. Lift your eyebrows slightly when you are hitting a high note or holding a dance movement. Keep your mouth relaxed and open. Use your smile at the end of your performance to show the audience you are happy with your performance, and they should be as well., Remember that you are performing for an audience, who will be watching your every move. Be aware of how you appear when you perform by practicing your performance in front of a mirror. This could be a full length mirror in your bedroom or a mirror in a dance studio or practice space., Avoid the performance jitters by doing a dry run of your performance in front of a receptive, friendly audience of family and friends. Set up a mock stage and a few seats in your living room. Try to pretend you are in the auditorium where you will be perform at the talent show and give it your all. You should feel more comfortable and confident performing in front of friends and family., After you perform for family and friends, you should ask them for feedback and listen patiently to what they have to say. They may give you basic feedback, like project your singing voice more, hold a certain note, or make sure you acknowledge the crowd at the end of your act. Take this feedback and use it to improve your act so it is ready for the real talent show.  Calm any pre-performance nerves by being prepared on the day of the talent show. This means having all your stage props ready, having your costume on hand, and making sure everyone in your band is present for the show. You may want to take time after school to prepare for the show, packing a bag of supplies that you will need for your performance.  You know what they say, “save the best for last”. Going last in the lineup may help you get a leg up on the competition and help to calm your nerves, especially if you need time to get used to being around the other performers and to being on stage. Going last can also allow you to create a lasting impression on the judges that will be fresh in their minds as they deliberate the winners of the show.  Take some time to sit in the audience and observe your competition, on the day of the talent show or during rehearsals for the show (if applicable). Notice if there are acts that are similar to your act or that use an element of your act. You may need to adjust your act so your version is more interesting and engaging. To win the show, you really need to focus on standing out from your competition.  Self-talk is your internal dialogue, which is often running in the background in your mind as you go through your day. Having positive self-talk on the day of the talent show can help you to perform at your best and give you the confidence you need to blow away the judges.Push negative thoughts out of your mind and focus on positive self-talk. This could mean not freaking out when you miss up a step in practice or skip a beat. Instead, tell yourself, “It’s okay, it’s just practice. I have time to get better at this.” You can also use positive self-talk as you perform for the judges. Remind yourself that you worked hard to get to this point and that you are the best performer on the stage. Tell yourself that you have all the skills and abilities to win.  A big part of performing at your best is putting your passion and attitude up front for the judges and the audience to see. This means not being afraid to get emotional during your performance and being yourself when you perform. Doing this will increase your chances of winning, on your terms.

article: If you're having difficulty turning the steering wheel or a high-pitched whining noise issues from the steering wheel when you turn it, chances are your power-steering fluid is low. The power-steering fluid can be found in a cylindrical reservoir near the power steering pump or remotely located with hoses from the pump, and should be clearly labeled. The cylinder may be made of either plastic or metal.   If you can't find the cylinder, consult your owner's manual for the location. While the power-steering reservoir is usually located in the same space in most cars, newer vehicles may place them elsewhere for economy or space.; , If the reservoir cylinder is made of translucent plastic, you may be able to see the fluid level inside the cylinder. If the reservoir cylinder is made of metal, or if the plastic is not sufficiently transparent, you'll check the fluid level with a dipstick, which is usually attached to the cap.   On some cars, the power-steering fluid level can only be checked accurately after the engine has run for a brief period, and sometimes you must also turn the steering wheel in either direction several times while the car idles. On other cars, there are gradations on the dipstick or cylinder for both a "hot" level, after the engine has been running, and a "cold" level, after the engine has been off for a period of time. On still other cars, there may be "Min" and "Max" lines for acceptable fluid levels. Be sure to compare the power-steering fluid level against the correct mark.  If you are using a dipstick to test the power-steering fluid level, first wipe off any excess fluid from the dipstick w

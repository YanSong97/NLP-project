article: washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- isis is a problem that is `` off the charts historically '' and has sent the united states into `` uncharted territory '' when it comes to putting down the terror group , the obama administration 's point man in the fight recently told cnn . the comments , which brett mcgurk made in an exclusive interview , were some of the administration 's strongest to date in describing the challenge the united states and its allies face in battling isis . `` this is a problem that is off the charts historically , '' he said , referring to the more than 20,000 foreign fighters who have gone into syria . `` just put that into perspective : it 's about twice the number that went into afghanistan in the 1980s over a 10-year period to fight the soviet union , and those came really from only a handful of countries . '' he concluded , `` we 're in unchartered territory here . '' mcgurk just returned from an urgent summit of coalition nations held in jordan . last week , canada became the latest nation to conduct airstrikes against isis over syria . the united states now lists 62 countries in the coalition . as the u.s.-led coalition has focused attention on iraq and syria , isis has expanded its reach to libya , egypt and yemen , often with existing extremist groups pledging allegiance to the militants . mcgurk did not rule out expanding u.s. military action beyond iraq and syria to combat the increasing regional threat . `` we have a lot of tools to protect ourselves and our national security interests , some of which are military tools , '' he said . `` of course we apply those tools when the president determines and our chain of command makes the recommendation that that is the right thing to do . '' the united states has also been stepping up efforts to involve sunni groups in the fight against isis . to date , that involvement has been extremely limited as sunni tribes see shiite militias , many with horrendous human rights records , take the lead . but mcgurk said that iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi is making progress getting sunni tribes to support a planned iraqi offensive against isis in anbar province in the coming weeks . he stressed the importance of working with al-abadi , noting that the iraqi leader was in anbar province last week handing out more than 1,000 ak-47s to tribal fighters who are going to join the iraqi security forces . `` we are helping to enable and train -lrb- them -rrb- as they begin to go on the offensive over the coming weeks and months in anbar , '' mcgurk said . `` they put out this very perverse , twisted vision , and it 's very attractive to a lot of young men around the world , '' he acknowledged . `` but in fact , what the foreign fighters are finding in syria and iraq is that they 're more likely to get killed in iraq and syria , and in fact , instead of getting a slave bride as isis leaders promise them , they 're more likely to get killed by a female peshmerga fighter in the streets of kobani . '' that bottom line , he assessed , could turn the tide : `` the foreign fighters are learning the reality of what it 's like when they go to join this twisted version of a caliphate , and i think we 're going to see those networks begin to dry up . ''

article: the heartbroken grandmother of a toddler who died of massive head injuries after her drug-addicted mother and violent partner forced her to ride a motorbike that repeatedly crashed has wept with relief at a coroner 's findings . little chloe valentine , 4 , died of massive head injuries after being forced to ride a motorbike that repeatedly crashed over a three-day period in the backyard of her adelaide home in january 2012 . her mother , ashlee polkinghorne , and her then partner are in jail after pleading guilty to chloe 's manslaughter through criminal neglect . in an emotional statement outside the adelaide inquest on thursday , chloe 's grandmother belinda valentine welcomed coroner mark johns ' ruling that families sa was broken and fundamentally flawed and that the agency 's lack of action over chloe 's mother 's drug use was a complete failure . ` the sun comes up tomorrow even though you do n't want it to , ' mrs valentine said . at an inquest into her death on tuesday authorities said social workers missed the chance to save chloe valentine , 4 , who died of massive head injuries in 2012 . in an emotional statement outside the adelaide inquest on thursday , chloe 's grandmother belinda valentine welcomed coroner mark johns ' ruling that families sa was broken and fundamentally flawed . the inquest has heard chloe was forced to endure chronic neglect at the hands of her drug-using teenage mother ashlee polkinghorne -lrb- left -rrb- and her partner benjamin robert mcpartland -lrb- right -rrb- . ` we are actually the lucky ones , because we had chloe in our life ' , her grandmother said . ` we are actually the lucky ones , because we had chloe in our life . ` she loved us , and we loved her very much . ` she will always be our four-year-old , but as we move forward she will always come with us . in a scathing verdict , the coroner found social workers ` flagrantly disregarded ' their legal responsibilities to seize children from neglectful parents . mr johns said nothing short of a ` massive overhaul ' was required by the agency . ' -lrb- families sa -rrb- took the path of least resistance , and the whole history of its dealing with ashlee is a history of drift , irresolution and aimlessness , ' he said . mr johns described polkinghorne as an ` accomplished and manipulative liar ' who easily fooled her case workers . ` ashlee was given virtually limitless opportunities to address her problems , ' he said . she was often given the benefit of the doubt by social workers , who helped clean her house and avoided confronting her about her drug use . polkinghorne was also provided with three supported accommodation sites and government-subsidised childcare . the young girl was forced to ride a motorbike for days on end by her drug addicted mother and her partner . chloe died in 2012 from head injuries sustained after being forced to ride a motorbike three times her weight for days on end by her drug addicted mother ashley polkinghorne and her partner at the time . belinda valentine said she repeatedly begged authorities to take chloe off her parents and into her care . he said the agency made a ` mistake ' when they declared it was unnecessary to drug test polkinghorne , a known amphetamine user , and condemned the ` rigid ' agency 's failure to consider chloe 's grandmother as a potential guardian . before chloe died , families sa received 20 abuse notifications from friends and family concerned about the girl 's filthy , transient and unsafe living conditions . handing down 22 recommendations to improve the system , mr johns said there had been a lack of analysis , lack of clinical supervision and a lack of leadership . during the inquest , counsel for families sa , michael grant , said it was n't clear whether chloe would have been saved if the agency had intervened more forcefully . ` families sa does operate in a hideous and imperfect world , ' he said . ` it 's not certain , in my submission , what would have happened if that circuit breaker had been applied . ' the south australian government is expected to respond to the coroner 's finding later on thursday . mrs valentine said the coroner 's recommendations ` can be taken now ' . belinda valentine -lrb- left -rrb- has slammed families sa saying they could have saved her granddaughter chloe valentine 's -lrb- right -rrb- life . ms valentine said she called social worker leanne stewart from the scene of a domestic dispute pleading to take chloe away from ashley . however ms stewart -lrb- pictured -rrb- denied in court that such a phone call ever took place . a comprehensive review of chloe 's case had made clear that a ` circuit-breaker ' was needed to save the girl from the chaos in her life . the coroner has asked why chloe 's mother ashley was repeatedly given the benefit of the doubt . families sa received 20 child abuse notifications during chloe 's short life from witnesses concerned about the girl 's filthy , transient and unsafe living conditions .

article: comments : veteran broadcaster peter alliss has sparked controversy by claiming gender equality laws have backfired and ` b ***** ed up the game ' veteran broadcaster peter alliss has sparked controversy by claiming gender equality laws have backfired and ` b ***** ed up the game ' . alliss , 84 , has said that legislation designed to stop golf clubs from discriminating against female members has instead prompted a decline in women 's membership . some clubs had previously only allowed female members if they played at restricted times in return for a discounted membership fee . but the equality act 2010 , drafted by the previous labour government , ruled that this was illegal discrimination , which means that women must now have equal access to the course -- and pay the same membership rates as men . mr alliss , a former professional who is one of the game 's most decorated players , claimed that tens of thousands of members of the ladies ' golf union have deserted the organisation since the rules came into force . ` i 'm told the ladies ' golf union has lost 150,000 members since equality for women came in , ' mr alliss told the radio times . ` hundreds of women have left golf clubs because they 've gone from paying half fare to full fare . it 's caused mayhem . ' he added : ` equality for women : a few people battled away to get it , they got it , and they have buggered up the game for a lot of people . ' but sam burton , finance director at the ladies ' golf union , said there has only been a decline of 30,000 women since the law came into force , taking membership down to 159,000 by last year . mrs burton said : ` it 's not good that ladies golf is declining and we have to look at it , but i do n't think it 's the equalities legislation that is to blame . golf has been dominated by men and we are always going to be the minority in any club that is mixed . but on the whole golf is becoming much more equal . ' rant : he added : ` equality for women : a few people battled away to get it , they got it , and they have buggered up the game for a lot of people . ' she suggested that possible reasons why golf was not as popular among women included the fact that it was quite an expensive activity and that other sports such as cycling ` have been marketed more successfully at women ' . she added : ` in 2015 we have to encourage equality and i certainly would n't be a member at a club where i was treated differently just because i was a woman . ` i think a lot of ladies would feel the same in this day and age . ' however , tory mp philip davies said he agreed with mr alliss , adding : ` this is the consequence of all the legislation . the equality fanatics ca n't pick and choose -- they either want full equality or they do n't . if they want full equality then they are going to have to pay the same price as everybody else . ` i do n't suppose -lsb- mr alliss 's -rsb- view is outdated . his view is a factual view to be perfectly honest . he is looking at the practicalities of it . ' the equality act applies to clubs with mixed memberships . male-only golf clubs are still legal . mr alliss became a professional golfer in 1947 , represented britain in the ryder cup eight times and won 21 tournaments in his career . he began working for the bbc in 1961 .

article: barclays chairman sir david walker defended the bank 's decision to pay out # 1.86 billion in bonuses . furious barclays shareholders vented frustration at the generous pay packages handed to hundreds of its top traders yesterday -- with one investor asking : ` what has their `` talent '' ever done for us ? ' the scandal-hit lender faced a barrage of criticism from long-suffering investors , many of them pensioners , at its annual general meeting in london . shareholders are reeling from big losses in their investments and pension funds as barclays ' share price has plunged since the financial crisis . last year its profits dropped again by 21 per cent to # 2.3 billion after it was hit by huge bills for wrongdoing . but yesterday chairman sir david walker defended the bank 's decision to pay out # 1.86 billion in bonuses , including packages of more than # 1million to 359 employees . group chief executive antony jenkins saw his pay package more than triple to # 5.5 million , after opting to accept a # 1.1 million bonus . facing criticism over the pay package , sir david claimed the bank needed to pay ` competitively ' to attract the best talent . but the argument received short shrift from investors who have seen barclays fork out billions for various scandals while the share price has fallen from # 7 to just under # 2.60 . during the height of the financial crisis in 2009 they fell to 47p , leaving many savers who sold their shares with huge losses . shareholder phil clarke said : ` employees should share the wealth created by great companies . my problem is what happens when there is no success -- and there is limited success in this company . ' referring to monty python 's ` what have the romans ever done for us ' sketch , mr clarke said : ` i 'd like to paraphrase monty python and ask what has all this `` talent '' done for us ? ` the answer is this talent has made losses for shareholders , destroyed value and dragged our reputation through the mud to the extent that banker has become a dirty word . yet these people have enjoyed massive salaries and we 've paid for it . ' at the meeting , barclays ' bosses referred repeatedly to the moral values of the bank 's quaker founders , with chairman sir david describing how they ` relied on their own hard work , pioneering spirit and moral code to become trusted figures in their communities ' . huge bonuses : group chief executive antony jenkins saw his pay package more than triple to # 5.5 million , after accepting a # 1.1 million bonus . sir david said the bank had to pay ` competitively ' to attract the best talent . billion pound bill : barclays is currently waiting for a huge fine for manipulating the # 3trillion-a-day foreign exchange market , and has set aside almost # 1.3 billion so far for the scandal . rogue traders in london orchestrated a worldwide conspiracy to rig interest rates , landing germany 's biggest bank with a record # 1.7 billion fine . several banks have already been penalised after traders were caught manipulating libor interest rates , which are used to set the cost of mortgages and are linked to trillions of dollars of investments around the world . so far total fines against banks including barclays and royal bank of scotland have hit # 5.6 billion . but the latest settlement dwarfs the # 1billion levied against ubs in 2012 , which was previously the biggest fine issued for rigging libor rates . at least 29 employees were involved in the wrongdoing , which lasted between january 2005 and december 2010 . most of the rogue staff were based in london , but they also worked in frankfurt , toyko and new york -- showing the global nature of the conspiracy . so far just 12 of the people involved in rate-rigging have been sacked , but us regulators have now ordered deutsche bank to fire another seven staff , including six senior employees in london . richard lloyd , executive director at consumer group which ? , said : ` rigged markets will ultimately hit people in the pocket , so the regulator must continue to take tough action . ' jurgen fitschen and anshu jain , co-chief executive officers of deutsche bank , said : ` the bank accepts the findings of the regulators . we deeply regret this matter but are pleased to have resolved it . ' but the comments incensed one pensioner -- who pointed to the ` criminal ' behaviour of barclays in the 21st century . barclays is currently waiting for a huge fine for manipulating the # 3trillion-a-day foreign exchange market , and has set aside almost # 1.3 billion so far for the scandal . last year it was also forced to set aside # 1.1 billion for mis-selling payment protection insurance , taking its total bill so far to # 5.2 billion . michael mason -- mahon said : ` the men who started it were honourable . but you seem to have lost your way . ' he added : ` our society can not longer cope with bankers that are hell-bent on criminal acts , leaving shareholders to pick up the tab . '

article: these days , gazza is a celebrity associated with tears , and battles against drink and depression . but , nearly a quarter of a century ago , paul gascoigne was just a footballer . not an ordinary footballer - he was a brilliantly talented maverick , but still a footballer . and 24 years ago today , he scored what was arguably the finest goal of his career . there are some who might say it was the finest goal ever scored at wembley . the other main contender for that prize is probably another of his , for england against scotland at euro 96 . paul gascoigne hits the 35-yard free-kick that would cement his place in tottenham legend . the spurs midfielder struck a ferocious shot that has gone down as one of the all-time great goals at wembley . gascoigne 's goal came five minutes into an fa cup semi-final against tottenham 's arch-rivals , arsenal . gunners goalkeeper david seaman -lrb- right -rrb- got his hands to the ball but the power on gascoigne 's shot still beat him . but april 14 , 1991 was fa cup semi-final day . tottenham hotspur vs arsenal . fierce rivals battling it out for a place in the final when the oldest cup competition in football meant so much to every club that entered . arsenal won the league that year . but had you asked their fans at wembley that day whether they would rather win the title or the fa cup having knocked out spurs , and many would have opted for the latter . they did n't get the choice , however , and that was because of gascoigne . it took him just five minutes to make the indelible mark . tottenham won a free-kick 35 yards from goal . nobody suspected much . certainly not barry davies , who was commentating on the game for the bbc . gascoigne runs towards the spurs fans to celebrate as vinny samways -lrb- left -rrb- joins the wild scenes . the then england star leaps into the air to celebrate his glorious strike at the home of football . gascoigne 's goal set spurs on their way to a 3-1 victory , and they would go on to beat nottingham forest in the final . ` is gascoigne going to have a crack ? , ' he asked . it was a relaxed , throwaway question . ` he is you know , ' came the next line shortly after , excitement barely registering . gascoigne took a run-up at the ball , and swung hard with his right boot . he nailed it , right on the sweet spot . the shot quickly became a cannonball , bursting through david seaman 's gloves and into the top corner of the net , despite the goalkeeper getting his hands to the ball . ` oh i say ! ' screamed davies , whose commentary would now go down in legend as well as the goal . ` brilliant ! ' spurs fans celebrated wildly in the stands . ` that ... is ... schoolboy 's own stuff . oh , i bet even he ca n't believe it . ` is there anything left from this man to surprise us ? that is one of the finest free-kicks this stadium has ever seen .

article: -lrb- cnn -rrb- feidin santana , the man who recorded a south carolina police officer fatally shooting a fleeing , unarmed man , told cnn on thursday night he was told by another cop to stop using his phone to capture the incident . `` one of the officers told me to stop , but it was because i -lrb- said -rrb- to them that what they did it was an abuse and i witnessed everything , '' he told cnn 's `` anderson cooper 360 ˚ . '' santana told cooper an officer told him to wait where he was but eventually he left the scene to go to work . in other interviews , santana has said he feared for his life , which almost kept him from revealing the recording . santana recalled the moments when he recorded a roughly three-minute video of north charleston police officer michael slager shooting walter scott as scott was running away saturday . that evidence led to the officer 's firing and arrest on a murder charge . santana said when he first came on the scene while walking to his job he saw slager on top of scott , who was on the ground . he could hear the sound of a taser in use . at no time did santana see scott go after the taser . he believes scott was trying to get away . `` mr. scott never tried to fight , '' santana told cnn . police said slager used a taser against scott , but slager would also later tell a dispatcher that scott at some point had grabbed the taser . after slager shot scott five times , the officer went back to pick up something . santana thinks it was the taser but said he was n't 100 % sure what it was . neither the struggle nor the use of a taser was captured on video , because santana had yet to begin recording . what we know about officer slager . the cell phone video , which santana revealed this week , reignited national outcries surrounding police treatment of african-americans and led to a murder charge against slager , who is white . scott was black . police said slager pulled the 50-year-old scott over for a nonworking brake light on saturday morning . scott , according to a dash cam video , fled from slager for unexplained reasons , and the officer chased him on foot . when santana 's video begins , scott starts running away from the officer , with scott 's back to slager . the video shows slager shooting at scott eight times before scott falls down . who was walter scott ? scott 's mother , judy scott , told cooper this week that she would want to thank santana for coming forward . `` he was there . god planned that . he 's the ram in the bush -- i truly believe that , '' judy scott said . santana agreed . `` i think she was right , '' he said . `` god put me there for a reason . '' judy scott said she could n't watch the whole recording . `` when i saw my son running and i saw the policeman behind him , i could n't take it , '' she said . `` i had to turn away . i could n't handle it . in an interview with nbc 's matt lauer , santana suggested that he was giving media interviews in part to protect himself against retribution . `` at some point i thought about staying anonymous , and do n't show my face , do n't talk about it . but ... if i would n't show my face , everybody over there knows , including the police , who i am , '' santana said . santana did not say whether he had received threats . his attorney , todd rutherford , said santana 's video would be useful in an investigation -- not only into the shooting but also into whether scott received prompt medical attention . in the last half of the video , a second officer appears to examine scott with gloved hands . witness video , official accounts raise questions . santana said after he stopped recording , he watched for a few more minutes but never saw anyone perform cpr . a police report says a third officer -- not shown in the video -- reported seeing an officer administering first aid , and that the third officer approached and helped that person `` with first aid and cpr . '' on wednesday , asked whether cpr was performed on scott , north charleston police chief eddie driggers said : `` in the end of it -lrb- the video -rrb- , what i saw was -lrb- what i -rrb- believed to be a police officer removing the shirt of the individual and performing some type of life-saving -lrb- procedure -rrb- , but i 'm not sure what took place there .

article: a cafe owner has laid down a challenge to diners with a gut-busting morning meal that contains a whopping 4,000 calories . olly taylor , 27 , is offering his version the easter feast , which is stuffed with the equivalent of almost 100 teaspoons of sugar , at his black milk cafe in manchester 's northern quarter . the breakfast includes two types of cereal served in half an easter egg , with brownies , marshmallows and mini eggs , topped off with three different types of flavoured milk . the easter feast breakfast is available at the black milk cereal cafe in manchester 's northern quarter . up for the challenge : customer glen keogh attemps the 4,000-calorie meal which has 388g of sugar . the meal is so sweet it contains the equivalent of 388g of sugar or 97 teaspoons . for # 7 , customers looking to get their day off to a jittery start will be treated to a 291g milk chocolate easter egg , with one half used as a bowl , served on a bed of baked and caramelised white chocolate to support the structure . two cereals of choice are added together with a creme egg , a handful of mini eggs , home-made chocolate brownie and a flake chocolate bar . marshmallows and m&m 's are thrown into the mix , before the whole dish is generously drizzled in homemade dulce de leche - an argentinian take on condensed milk - and salted caramel sauce . he starts off in high spirits , pouring the first of the three milks into his chocolate ` bowl ' mr keogh takes on the easter feast -lrb- left -rrb- but barely gets through before he regrets his decision -lrb- right -rrb- . finally , customers are treated to three milks of choice which can be taken from a range including black squid ink milk , chocolate , strawberry , vanilla and good old semi-skimmed . mr taylor , whose cafe specialises in world cereals , milkshakes and cheesecake , says he has carried his fine-dining and knowledge of being a wine sommelier into black milk . he created the easter feast challenge to celebrate the gluttony of easter . cadbury 's chocolate egg -lrb- 291g -rrb- : 150g sugar ; 1,400 calories . baked caremalised white chocolate : 9g sugar ; 80 calories . kosher cereal from israel : 8g sugar ; 150 calories . toffee crisp cereal : 7.2 g sugar ; 150g calories . home-made brownie : 7g sugar ; 410 calories . creme egg : 26.5 g sugar ; 177 calories . mini eggs : 20.5 g sugar ; 148 calories . flake : 16.7 g sugar ; 171 calories . dulce de leche : 50g sugar ; 315 calories . salted caramel sauce 10g sugar ; 300 calories . milks : 30g sugar ; 300 calories . marshmallows : 40g sugar ; 75 calories . m&m s : 13g sugar ; 140 calories . total : 3,816 calories . average man needs 2,500 calories per day . ` it 's all in the spirit of easter , ' he said . ` easter is less about what is used to mean , and now on easter sunday people try and go through as many chocolate eggs as they can , so this is another challenge for them . ` no one has managed to finish it yet but we 'll be running it until the end of the bank holiday to see if anyone can . ' he said the initial idea for the easter feast came to him after seeing soup served inside giant bread bowls in paris and he wanted to transfer the concept to the cereal market . ' i want to push it further and come up with wacky concoctions and push the limits of cereal and milk and what you can do with it , ' he said . although his cafe may stake a claim to creating britain 's most tooth-rotting dish , mr taylor is keen to point out some of the shop 's biggest sellers are muesli , special k and protein granolas used as an after-gym snack . sweet-toothed customer glen keogh bravely attempted the challenge , opting for toffee crisp and a kosher cereal from israel as his two choices . he said : ' i absolutely love chocolate , so this seemed like it would be a doddle at first . ` after tucking straight into the crème egg , the flake and the brownie , i realised even that was more chocolate than anybody needs to eat in one sitting . ` the cereal was delicious , but like the easter egg bowl once the milk was poured , i started to crumble . ` ten minutes , an aching belly and fuzzy teeth later , i called it a day with just the bowl to spare . my nine-year-old self would have been disappointed , but he did n't have to pay to go to the dentist ! ' the easter feast is made of half a cadbury 's chocolate egg ; baked caremelised white chocolate ; kosher cereal from israel ; toffee crisp cereal ; home-made brownie ; creme egg ; mini eggs ; flake ; dulce de leche ; salted caramel sauce ; three milks ; marshmallows and m&m 's . olly taylor starts the assembly process for his sugar-laden easter feast breakfast .

article: angela spent many years wearing high heel shoes . four years ago , a shopping trip was torture for angela kelly , 67 . though still a super-fit events organiser , the former over-50s all england badminton mixed doubles champion was reduced to hobbling at a snail 's pace , hanging onto her trolley for support . it may sound as though angela was struggling with a debilitating disease or catastrophic accident . in fact , she was suffering from the painful legacy of a lifetime wearing high heels . her story is a cautionary tale for those of us who blithely slip our feet into shoes several inches high on a daily basis . most women are well aware that wearing high heels for any length of time can result in sore feet , pinched toes and tight calf muscles . but a worrying new study by researchers in the u.s. suggests high heels can also put dangerous pressure on knee joints , wearing away cartilage - the body 's built-in shock absorber - and increasing the risk of osteoarthritis . some women need invasive knee replacement surgery . in the study carried out by stanford university 's biomotion team , the knees of healthy women were scanned as they walked at normal pace in flat shoes , 1 1/2 in heels and 3 1/2 in heels . they found that in high heels , women 's knees are held in such an awkward , bent position that their joints looked and performed like aged or damaged joints - increasing the risk of osteoarthritis . physiotherapist and osteopath tim allardyce is n't surprised : patients with postural problems caused or exacerbated by heels are common at his croydon clinic . ` because of the odd angle at which the feet are held in high-heeled shoes , it increases the downward pressure on the knees by 25 per cent , placing significant stress on the kneecaps , even when you 're standing still , ' he says . at 5ft 3in , angela had always loved the extra height afforded by her favourite heels . ' i wore vertiginous stilettos and towering platforms every day of my teens and 20s , ' she says . ` and after that , a 3 in heel or more , whenever i wanted to look smart . ' even the first twinge of arthritis , which began in her right knee in her early 30s , could n't persuade her to kick her heel habit - instead , she gritted her teeth and controlled the pain with anti- inflammatories , until it suddenly worsened four years ago . she had almost no cartilage left in her knee and needed to have a titanium knee replacement . ' i was struggling to get out of bed or in and out of the car , ' she says . ' i sometimes had to use crutches to get about and would have to lean heavily on a trolley to get around the supermarket . ` all my lovely high-heeled shoes had to be banished and i started living in trainers . ` my husband rob and my friends were all very sweet , telling me i looked great in my frumpy , flat shoes and encouraging me to get my knee sorted out - but i felt really down about it . ` if i walked any distance or tried to play badminton , my knee would swell horribly and i 'd have to apply ice packs to control the pain . ` tests showed that i had almost no cartilage left in my knee and it became obvious that i needed to have a titanium knee replacement , which involved major surgery and a lengthy recovery period . ' luckily , angela 's knee surgery at the royal bolton hospital in 2011 was a success . after following the advice of her doctor and physiotherapist to swear off heels altogether , to avoid damaging her new , artificial knee , she is fitter than ever . she has lost 1 1/2 st , is playing badminton several times a week and goes to the gym regularly . ' i miss my heels and envy friends who can still wear them , ' she says . the average woman spends # 136.52 on five new pairs of shoes a year . the knee op was n't her only surgery . ' i had to have a bunion surgically removed from my left foot last year , too , which was caused - or certainly worsened - by years of wearing tight , pointy stilettos . ' i probably would have paid more attention to the fit of my shoes , rather than how fashionable they looked , if i 'd known they would force me to go under the knife twice . ' vanity is the obvious reason why angela is far from the only woman willing to suffer for fashion - there 's no question that legs look longer and more elegant in beautiful heels . in a recent survey of 1,200 women , 93 per cent said they felt sexier and more feminine when they wore heels , 88 per cent said they considered themselves more stylish and 77 per cent said their heels made them feel slimmer . with statistics like those , it 's no surprise that many women seem to take a dangerously ` no pain , no gain ' approach to their footwear , however dire the warnings . retired teacher susan owens , 61 , has also suffered life-changing knee problems from wearing heels since she was a teenager . ` my husband and i go on a lot of cruises , and recently took up ballroom dancing , which call for lots of dressing up and wearing high-heels for hours on end , ' she says . but unbearable knee pain that began in 2010 , when she was 55 , threatened to curtail her leisure activities altogether . susan owens has also suffered life-changing knee problems from wearing heels . ` at first , i just put the pain down to ageing and tried to soldier on , but as time went on , over-the-counter painkillers stopped working and the niggling , arthritic pains were keeping me awake at night , ' she says . ` six months after they started , i went to see my doctor and was given steroid injections in my knee . they really helped in the short term , but i still found i could n't wear heels when we went out or on holiday - it was just too painful . ' i was still teaching young children at the time , but i struggled to kneel down beside them in the classroom . i could n't drive and as i stopped being so active , i started to pile on weight and suddenly felt old , despondent and frumpy . ' susan had to undergo arthroscopies - keyhole surgery to remove damaged cartilage - on both knees before a right knee replacement by orthopaedic surgeon shivanand geeranavar at bmi edgbaston hospital improved things . ` within six weeks of having my knee replaced i was driving again and went on holiday to italy . ` within nine weeks , i could ride my bike and go back to ballroom dancing . i still wear heels occasionally - mainly when i 'm dancing - but the heels are lower than they used to be . ' of course , arthritis and bunions are not the only problems that can be caused by high heels - squeezing feet into too-tight points can lead to misshapen hammer toes , and regular wearers of 3 in heels may suffer from tendonitis , where the achilles tendon shrinks and tightens painfully . tim allardyce says wearing high heels regularly can also be at the root of a raft of excruciatingly painful back , hip and even neck problems . ` standing and walking on the balls of your feet throws the skeleton out of its usual , healthy alignment , which means muscles and joints throughout the body have to compensate to maintain its centre of gravity and keep the body upright , ' he says . despite being otherwise fit and healthy , former bbc television sports presenter sally jones , 60 , blames her fondness for heels for the excruciatingly painful lower back problems that plagued her 40s and 50s . at times , the pain was so bad she was unable to drive and was forced to use a stick . ` high heels have always been considered part of a female tv presenter 's uniform , ' she says . ` not that i complained - high shoes have always be my preferred choice of footwear when i 've got to look smart . the shame is that i ca n't really wear them any more . ' though her back problems had been triggered by squash and tennis injuries in her 30s , sally was advised by an orthopaedic consultant and osteopath that her penchant for heels was exacerbating her problems . ' i was told to stick to flats or shoes with a very low heel and to spend as much time barefoot as possible to help correct my posture , which had been thrown out of alignment by wearing heels day in and day out , ' she says . standing and walking on the balls of your feet throws the skeleton out of its usual , healthy alignment . ' i was also given exercises to follow to strengthen my abdominals and back muscles , and help correct the poor postural habits i had developed , which were putting strain on my lower back . ` for the past 15 years , i 've had to stick to flat footwear and keep up the exercises to keep my back pain at bay . ' i still take heels with me to slip on for tv appearances , but the twinges in my back start if i have to stand in them for more than an hour . ' for high-heel lovers not yet suffering painful problems , podiatrist michael ratcliffe advises picking shoes carefully . ` if you are after height , wear a comfy platform or a shoe with a heavy block heel - which will give you support - rather than a flimsy stiletto with a thin sole , ' he says . and tim allardyce says : ` take a break . if you 're wearing a pair of heels over 2 in high , limit the time spent wearing them to two hours maximum . ` after two hours , sit down , take the heels off and walk around barefoot if possible for 30 minutes to allow time for your feet and knees to recover . ' interestingly , consultant knee surgeon marcus green , at the bmi priory hospital in birmingham , has even more hope for those who ca n't bear to part with their favourite footwear - he is not convinced the link between high heels and arthritis in the knees has been proved . ` there 's no doubt that high heels change the forces on the knee joint , but none of the long-term studies i 've seen suggest they go on to cause serious knee problems , ' he says . ` yes , there is a definite link to issues such as angela 's bunions and sally 's postural problems . ` but when it comes to knees , keeping your weight down and exercising regularly to keep the supportive muscles around the knees fit and strong are , in my opinion , by far the most important steps you can take to prevent or slow down arthritis in the knees .

article: ian walters , 51 , allegedly killed his wife tracy by deliberately driving their truck into a tree at 84mph . a church treasurer accused of murdering his wife deliberately veered his 4x4 off the m1 causing it to explode as it hit trees , a court heard today . leicester crown court was told that two dogs and suitcases were also thrown out of the pick-up truck being driven by ian walters as it crashed into a line of trees near markfield , leicestershire . yesterday the court was told that his wife , tracy walters , died after making a flurry of calls to police about sex-obsessed husband in the days leading up to the m1 crash , including one that morning . prosecutors allege that walters , a driving test examiner , deliberately steered his mitsubishi l200 off the motorway after his wife said she wanted a divorce and made allegations of domestic abuse . walters , 51 , denies the murder of his wife , who died in hospital two days after the high-speed crash . a jury of nine women and three men was told yesterday that walters , of swindon , was returning home with his wife from a ` make-or-break ' week away in north yorkshire which ended in an argument . giving evidence to the second day of walters ' trial , several witnesses described how passing motorists went to aid the couple , both trapped in the wreckage of the 4x4 . the first witness , robin goss , told jurors the driver of the pick-up appeared to have made a ` conscious , deliberate ' decision to steer towards the hard shoulder . mr goss , a 39-year-old training consultant from buckinghamshire , told jurors he was up to 150 metres behind the l200 , doing around 70mph in the inside lane . ` everything was normal , ' mr goss told the court . ` then all of a sudden i saw this car just swerve violently across to the left . ` it completely disappeared and i remember looking into the hard shoulder . then i saw what looked like a little explosion . ` bits of tree and bits of plastic came out in front of me . when i saw the dogs , i started to put together what had happened . ' child protection worker gary donald , who was driving a kia picanto on the southbound carriageway , also gave evidence to the court about the crash on march 21 last year . he told jurors he saw the pick-up veer sharply from right to left - performing ` almost a straight turn ' - and move towards a line of trees . the couple , who were said to have had a ` troubled ' relationship , had married in cyprus in 2012 but their relationship is alleged to have become abusive soon afterwards , jurors heard . ` the canopy of all the trees shook - i would use the word ` imploded ' - and there was luggage , bits of car , and parts of tree flying into the air , ' mr donald said . under questioning from defence qc christopher millington , mr donald agreed that time-lapse cctv footage of the l200 showed a ` rather less dramatic ' veer than he had described to the court . witness steven prince , a passenger in a range rover which stopped at the scene , told how he attempted to reassure mrs walters before she was cut free . giving his recollection on the aftermath of the crash , mr prince told the jury panel he did not witness the moment of impact but had seen a cloud of dust . ' i looked left and i saw two dogs out where they should n't be and i saw the car that was already in the tree . ' after the crash , the metalwork of the vehicle had to be ` unpeeled ' from around mrs walters by emergency crews , the court was told . the mitsubishi l200 veered onto an embankment near junction 22 of the southbound carriageway in march last year . pictured : emergency services at the scene of the crash . prosecutors allege that walters , a driving test examiner , deliberately steered his mitsubishi l200 off the motorway after his wife said she wanted a divorce and made allegations of domestic abuse . after getting out of his mother 's car , mr prince said , he ran along the hard shoulder towards the crashed vehicle . ` the car was a hell of a mess , ' mr prince added . ' i did n't bother looking at the driver 's side because i thought whoever was in there was going to be squashed . ' the court heard that the witness then made his way to the passenger side of the vehicle , where he saw a hand sticking out of the wreckage . he said : ` she said she was dying . i told her she would be alright and that i was n't going anywhere , just to calm her down and make her feel at ease as much as i could . ' prosecutor charles miskin qc asked mr prince if mrs walters , who was aged 48 , had said anything else . ` no , other than that she could n't breathe , ' mr prince replied . ` she kept on telling me that and she kept on saying that she was dying . ' the trial , which may last for up to a month , was adjourned until next week . sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article .

article: london -lrb- cnn -rrb- british police investigating a spectacular heist in the heart of london 's jewelry district said friday they knew a burglar alarm went off but did n't respond . southern monitoring alarm company called the metropolitan police service , also known as scotland yard , at 12:21 a.m. april 3 to report that the burglar alarm had been activated at hatton garden safe deposit ltd. , mps said in a prepared statement . `` the call was recorded and transferred to the police 's cad -lrb- computer-aided dispatch -rrb- system , '' the statement said . `` a grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required . we are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call . this investigation is being carried out locally . `` it is too early to say if the handling of the call would have had an impact on the outcome of the incident . '' the theft was so big that police have n't come up with a value for what was stolen . over the four-day easter holiday , thieves broke into the vault of hatton garden safe deposit ltd. and might have been able to take as long as four days to rifle through the boxes . a former police official in london has speculated that the loss could run to # 200 million , or $ 300 million , in a remark widely reported by news media . numerous british news organizations put the value of the loss in the hundreds of thousands of pounds . detective chief inspector paul johnson of the london metropolitan police flying squad said police were still identifying the owners of ransacked safe deposit boxes and trying to contact them to learn what had been lost . the british tabloid the daily mirror claimed friday to have obtained closed-circuit tv footage that captured the robbery being carried out . the video showed people inside the building dressed like utility workers with their faces covered . they carried large bags , what looked like drill equipment and other tools , then exited with trash bins . toward the end of the video , a white van can be seen on a street during daytime with individuals loading back their gear and the trash bins . british police told cnn they have not released any video of the heist . when asked about the video published by the daily mirror , police said they could not confirm that it was footage from the hatton garden robbery and that officers have not seen that particular video . the daily mirror published time-stamped images it said showed that the thieves had been -- as was feared -- in the vault for days . the mirror 's time stamps , which cnn has not been able to independently verify , show employees locking up for the weekend at 9:19 p.m. on thursday . if the footage , and its interpretation by the newspaper are correct , at least six people were involved in the heist . just four minutes later , the first of the thieves , nicknamed `` mr. ginger '' by the newspaper for his red hair , appears in the building holding a black bag . he goes downstairs toward the vault . at 9:27 p.m. , a street camera shows a white ford transit van pulling up to an alley beside the hatton garden safe deposit building . men are seen dragging trash bins down the alley before the van drives away , leaving the men behind . inside the building , at 9:30 p.m. , the camera records a thief nicknamed `` the gent '' for his natty clothing -- though he also wears a hard-hat and a high-visibility jacket labeled `` gas '' on the back . a minute later , `` mr. strong '' appears , wearing a builder 's hat and carrying steel supports , which the newspaper speculates could have been used to support the diamond-tipped drill used to smash through the wall of the vault . at 9:36 p.m. , mr. strong and a thief nicknamed mr. montana for the logo on his hooded sweatshirt roll in trash bins , one of which might have contained , according the mirror , the 77-pound drill that bored through the reinforced seven-foot concrete wall to reach the vault . it is unclear , but the thieves may have spent the night in the basement in or near the vault . at any rate , according to the daily mirror , no more activity is seen above ground until friday morning , shortly before 8:00 . the white van returns , is loaded in two minutes , and drives off again . on saturday evening , mr. ginger returns , two days after he was first seen . the newspaper says is wearing latex gloves and carrying a black sack . he goes downstairs toward the vault . saturday evening also marked the first appearance of the tall man , who helped carry some of the loot out of the building . early sunday , mr ginger , the tall man and a robber nicknamed the old man are seen to be active . the tall man and the old man struggle to move a bin before they drag it outside . the old man leans on the bin , struggling for breath , and reveals the side of his face to the camera . a white van arrives by the alley and the men start loading equipment on it , including several trash bins . three men get into the white van and , at 6:44 a.m. they are gone . the heist would not be reported to police for two more days , on tuesday morning when employees of the company arrived for work . police said thursday there was no sign of forced entry . johnson said the thieves appeared to have gained access to the vault through the shaft of an elevator that is used by several businesses in the building . the thieves disabled the elevator on the second floor of the building -- which would be called the third floor in the united states -- then climbed down the elevator shaft into the basement , he said . once there , he said , they used a drill to bore through a 6-foot-thick wall and gain access to the vault where the safe deposit boxes were . people with knowledge of the area have speculated that cash and jewels were probably taken . some jewelry businesses reportedly stored some of their jewels in the boxes rather than leaving it in their stores over the holiday weekend . johnson said the scene in the vault remained chaotic as police continued their forensic examination . he said the floor was covered with dust and littered with safe deposit boxes and power tools . watch : top five jewelry heists . johnson called the crime sophisticated and said there were a limited number of people in the united kingdom capable of pulling it off . he said he had no idea whether the thieves were still in the country . although there was no sign of forced entry to the building , the detective said , `` whether that involves inside knowledge will form part of the investigation . '' hatton garden is a storied area in london and the heart of the city 's diamond trade . the area 's promotional website says it is home to `` the largest and most concentrated cluster of jewellery retailers in the uk '' and has been for quite some time . `` history tells us that the old city of london had certain streets -- or quarters -- dedicated to specific types of business , '' the website says . `` the hatton garden area has been the epicentre of london 's jewellery trade since medieval times . `` today , it maintains its international reputation as the centre of london 's diamond trade . it is one of the finest and most renowned jewellery locations in the world . '' how was $ 4.8 million in gold swiped from a north carolina highway ? the website of hatton garden safe deposit ltd. says the company was founded in 1954 and offers a `` secure and cost-effective solution to store and protect important and irreplaceable personal belongings .

article: fleece jackets , piles of hay , a fuzzy stuffed animal sloth and a lot of fruit were on bobbi gordon 's shopping list when she became a surrogate mother to a big-eyed , spikey-haired little boy . a handful of animal keepers at salt lake city 's hogle zoo found themselves with a tiny red-headed charge when eve , a bornean orangutan , died a few weeks after giving birth . now 5 months old , the 14-inch , 11-pound tuah is starting to crawl . scroll down for video . a new addition : tuah , the five month-old bornean orangutan looks on in the great ape building at utah 's hogle zoo on friday . tuah was revealed to the public on saturday , with visitors -- some of whom wore ' i met tuah ' buttons -- lining up around the ape building to catch their first glimpse . about 9,000 people visited the zoo saturday , said erica hansen , the zoo 's community relations coordinator . ` it was such a larger day -lrb- for attendance -rrb- than we usually have in april , ' she said . gordon is one of several primate handlers who provided round-the-clock care for the infant , improvising along the way . ` we lived like an orangutan , ' gordon said . ` it was exhausting . ' orphan : tuah 's parents eve and elijah , both passed away last fall just a few weeks after tuah 's birth . orangutans spend most of their time in trees . a baby orangutan instinctively clings to his mother 's fur while she builds nests and scavenges for food . so tuah could n't be swaddled and put in a crib like a human baby ; he needed to hang onto someone , even while sleeping . a zoo employee used specialized sewing machines and old fleece jackets to make a vest with strips that simulate an orangutan 's fur . the animal keepers took turns wearing the vest and crawling in hay , while tuah held tight to their chests , developing his muscle strength . but tuah ca n't cling to humans forever . that 's where his sister , acara , comes in . after tuah 's birth , zookeepers began training acara on maternal duties . acara will turn 10 next month and is an eager-to-please orangutan that enjoys learning , gordon said . ` gorillas are a whole other different story , but orangutans are very easy , ' said gordon with a laugh . she called the species ` insanely intelligent . ' taken care of : after four months of round-the-clock care from zookeepers and his older sister , an orphaned orangutan baby is ready to meet the public . the first step was to teach acara to be gentle with the infant . ` she was young and spunky , so that was our biggest worry , that she would n't know what was too rough , ' said gordon . they plied acara with rewards . the more complicated the task , the higher-value the treat : from the everyday fruit to her favorite grapes and pomegranates to the foods she only gets on special occasions , like jello , granola , graham crackers , applesauce and peanuts . when acara had mastered being gentle , zookeepers gave her a stuffed animal to teach her how to pick the baby up , hold it and flip it over . the two were introduced when tuah was 3 months old , and for the last month , they have lived together full time , gordon said . acara has adjusted to child-rearing and will retrieve tuah for animal keepers and carry him between exhibits . she also helps tuah navigate the ropes and stops him from tripping on toys . on saturday , tuah spent a lot of time holding onto the ropes and occasionally wandered up to the glass , giving visitors outside the enclosure an up close glance . ` he stayed awake and fought off his nap until about 3:30 , ' hansen said . tuah 's father was eli , an orangutan who became famous for correctly predicting the super bowl winner seven years in a row . eli died of cancer in september , but officials hope tuah inherited his ability . ` tuah 's going to try it next year , ' gordon said . lost her parents : tuah 's father , now dead , gained national fame by correctly picking the super bowl winner seven straight years is ready to meet the public .

article: janet faal , who has suffered from agoraphobia for a decade , fell down an uncovered manhole . an agoraphobic grandmother who conquered her fear of open spaces and left home for the third time in 10 years only to fall down a manhole . janet faal , 57 , was out with a friend in crawley , west sussex , as part of her rehabilitation when she moved a wooden pallet to help them reverse and plunged down into the open gap . she now has two black eyes and a suspected fractured leg after smashing her face on the pallet and was left in a ` splits ' position as only one of her legs went down the hole when she slipped . the grandmother-of-four said : ' i was with a friend helping her reverse out of a car park , and there was this wooden pallet in the way . ' i moved the pallet out of the way with my foot and i was going to turn around to my friend say `` is that far enough ? '' . ' i took a step over - never in my life did i think there was a hole underneath , i thought it had just fallen over . the next thing i remember is the pain . it was awful . ' i fell and smashed my face on the pallet , and i was in the hole with blood all over me and i could n't move . ' she reckons she has been set back ` years ' in her battle with the debilitating condition , which has left her housebound for a decade , and fears she 'll never leave her home again . miss faal , who lives in crawley , said : ` it 's hard for me to go anywhere , but i was getting better . now i 'm not so sure . ' she spent nearly an hour waiting in agony on the forecourt of complete tyre services on friday , april 10 , before a paramedic arrived to take her to east surrey hospital . scroll down for video . her son andy macdonald , 39 , a painter and decorator , said : ` i 'm absolutely livid . whoever owns that manhole should get it fixed and get it fixed right now . ` it 's ruined my mother 's recovery . i ca n't believe it . whoever owns that manhole has something serious to answer for . miss faal was trying to move a wooden pallet when she fell down the gap , smashing her face and trapping her leg on the way down . she 's been left with two black eyes and bruising . ` i 'm self-employed , and i have to take time off work to care for my disabled mum , who has been knocked for six by negligence . ` if she was smaller she would have gone all of the way down - a slender woman or child could have been very seriously hurt . ' an employee at the company , where miss faal 's friend had driven her to get a new tyre for her car , claimed the holes have been reported ` loads of times ' to the owner of the site . the manhole -lrb- pictured -rrb- at complete tyre services in crawley had been covered by a wooden pallet . the site is leased from the owner of jp supplies , which sells safety clothing to the construction industry in the neighbouring unit . a spokesman for south east coast ambulance service confirmed its attendance and explained why it took so long for an ambulance to arrive . he said : ` when the call came in , with the information provided by the caller , it was classified as a `` class c '' call . ` we always do our best to back up the first paramedic as soon as we can but life-threatening calls have to take priority . ' neither the tyre shop or their landlord jp supplies are accepting responsibility for fixing the broken manhole . a worker at the garage said : ` we have been trying to get the manholes in the forecourt fixed for years , but what 's happened is they were covered with pallets . ' the building owner , who also runs nearby business jp services , said : ` they are the tenants , so it 's down to them to fix the manhole cover . ` i 'm the landlord , but they have not spoken to me about it . ' agoraphobia is ' a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult , or help would n't be available if things went wrong ' , according to the nhs website . the site explains that though it 's often thought that the condition is a fear of open spaces the reality is not quite as straightforward , with some sufferers also fearing public transport and shopping centres . when agoraphobics are exposed to their fears several symptoms can sweep over them , including a feeling of nausea , rapid heartbeat and breathing , and rising temperature . the cause of agoraphobia can vary from person to person , with some people developing a fear of a certain situation or place because they experienced a panic attack there and then try to avoid it . others may develop the condition through a fear of crime or being involved in an accident . treatments may involve counselling , relaxation training or taking antidepressants . nhs direct says : ` in the uk , up to two people in 100 have a panic disorder and it is . thought around a third of those will go on to develop agoraphobia as a . result .

article: mk dons boss karl robinson hailed the patience of his team as they beat doncaster 3-0 to keep the heat on preston at the top of league one . robinson 's team needed a freakish goal by dean bowditch , 25 minutes from time , to break doncaster 's resistance and stay within a point of the automatic promotion places with two games to play . substitute bowditch had only been on for a few seconds when a clearance by defender mitchell lund hit him on the head and looped into the net . mk dons midfielder carl baker celebrates scoring the second goal . league one player of the year dele alli of mk dons goes past them . mk dons winger samir carruthers goes on the attack during his side 's 3-0 win over doncaster . ` it 's our first time this season we 've had a fluke goal , it 's overdue , ' said robinson after carl baker , another substitute , had secured the win with two fine goals . ` we never lost patience . we showed great maturity and quality and that 's 12 goals in out last three games . ` to be on 85 points is sensational . if we win one more and get to 88 that will be a magnificent season . if we win them both and get 91 that 's unbelievable . if it 's not good enough to finish second we 'll go into the play-offs as the form team . ' meanwhile , preston remain in pole position to join champions bristol city in the championship next season as they stay a point ahead of the dons after a 3-1 win at notts county , who are staring relegation in the face . first-half goals from jermaine beckford and joe garner set up the success , before james spencer got the magpies back in it . but beckford 's second sealed it in the final 10 minutes to leave county two points adrift of safety with two games left . swindon look destined for the play-offs after only managing a 3-3 draw with walsall . the robins will have to win their remaining three games and hope that preston and the dons lose their last two to have any chance of gatecrashing the top two . jermaine beckford scored a brace for preston to help his side defeat notts county 3-1 on tuesday . joe garner -lrb- right -rrb- netted a first-half goal to double preston 's lead and set them on their way to a perfect win . goals from kieron morris and jordy hiwula put the saddlers two to the good only for two quickfire penalties from ben gladwin to bring swindon level . romaine sawyers ' effort 16 minutes from time looked to be decisive but jordan turnbull levelled late on for the robins . rochdale kept their faint play-off hopes alive with a 1-0 win over leyton orient , which leaves the o 's in dire straits at the other end of the table . ian henderson 's 66th-minute goal won it for dale who are five points adrift of the top six with two games to play and need chesterfield or sheffield united to drop points to get in the play-offs . orient , who were beaten play-off finalists last season , are two points adrift of safety . elsewhere , scunthorpe virtually guaranteed their third-tier status after a 1-1 draw at home to bradford . gary mcsheffrey put the iron ahead midway through the first half only for billy clarke to cancel it out just after the hour . however , mark robins ' men move six points clear of the bottom four with two games left and a superior goal difference to those teams below them .

article: sporting america fell in love with him because of his skill under pressure and his sheer bravura . the rest of america fell in love because of what happened after the winning putt was holed . the 79th masters attracted massive ratings in the usa and there is no surprise in that . they tuned in to watch as perfect a demonstration of sporting endeavour as you will ever behold . but they also tuned in to watch a man with a common touch and a depth of sincerity that reached into the heart of every household . politicians who try so hard to be popular could learn much from 21-year-old masters champion jordan spieth . the green jackets and dignitaries sitting behind him were enraptured as the winner gave an unscripted speech so gracious and natural you would think that public speaking was his calling rather than the royal and ancient game . jordan spieth wears his new green jacket after winning the masters at augusta on sunday . spieth hugs members of his family after securing his first ever major title at augusta national . spieth walks back onto the 18th green to formally acknowledge the large crowd watching on . as he stepped off the final green he embraced , in turn , his father shawn , his mother chris , his college sweetheart annie , his brother steven , who plays college basketball , his grandfather and various friends . and then he remembered his father 's words : ` make sure you say thank you to the people , son . ' so he went back on to the 18th green and formally acknowledged the patrons crammed into every available space . with this victory , spieth must have killed forever the idea that you have to have a cold heart and a ruthless edge to be a winner . you will not find a single pro on the pga tour with a bad word to say about him . there is nothing fake about jordan spieth . texans are supposed to be brash and larger than life , right ? this one makes jokes about his receding hairline and dislikes being asked why he comes across as humble because , well , that would not be humble . listen to phil mickelson , the masters specialist who cheerfully admitted he had been outplayed by a man who had competed at augusta only once before . ` he 's just a class guy in every way and it 's difficult not to root for him , ' said the leftie . spieth watches his tee shot on the seventh hole during the final round . spieth gives a fistpump after making a birdie putt on the third green on the final day . ` this is a momentous week in the history of our game . along with rory mcilroy , jordan spieth is going to carry it for the next decade and what an exciting time it promises to be . ' sir nick faldo , on american television , sums up perfectly the feelings of a sport at the end of truly epochal week . listen to jack nicklaus , who posted this tribute : ` congratulations to an exceptionally talented young man . that was an incredible performance . jordan is so beyond his years . i like everything about him . he 's polite , he 's humble , he handles himself so well , on and off the golf course . and he 's obviously a wonderful player and now a masters champion . ' the one family member who was not present to enjoy the celebrations was his 14-year-old sister ellie , who suffers from a neurological disorder that places her on the autism spectrum . hardly a day goes by when spieth does not facetime ellie and every time they talk she asks him if he has won yet . ` i 'll finally be able to tell her yes , ' he said , smiling . when spieth speaks about ellie there is no pity or anything maudlin in his voice , only joy , laughter and pride . ` i know she was watching on television and i think she 's going to be a bit jealous of us all hugging round the 18th green , ' he said . ` she 's going to want a present . ' golf should not have been spieth 's game at all . nobody in the family plays -- they are all big basketball fans . but spieth was given a set of plastic clubs at the age of four and took it from there . spieth -lrb- front -rrb- is presented with his green jacket by last year 's masters champion bubba watson . spieth kisses his girlfriend annie after a sensational victory at the masters . perhaps the only serious criticism he has attracted came when he dropped out of the university of texas after his first year . it was well-meaning . by the age of 19 he had an amateur record so good he had positively lapped his fellow competitors and done well in the us open , finishing 21st . but why the hurry ? why not complete his education ? throughout his life spieth has known exactly what he wants -- from the fact he is still with the girl he met in college to his caddie michael greller . he is a maths teacher by trade but spieth persuaded him to come out on tour after the pair hit it off straightaway . spieth just felt he was ready and it was not long before he was showing why . when he set out he was ranked 809th in the world . now he is no 2 behind rory mcilroy . in 18 months , he has banked more than $ 13million -lrb- # 8.86 m -rrb- on the pga tour alone . in his past four events he has won two and finished second twice and when he says : ` i do n't see this as a great run of form , i see this as normal , ' it does not come across as at all boastful . spieth -lrb- right -rrb- pictured with his college sweetheart girlfriend annie . spieth spends time with his family as he poses for a photo with sister ellie -lrb- centre -rrb- and brother steven -lrb- right -rrb- . asked about mcilroy , as ever , he found exactly the right words : ` he 's got four majors and numerous wins and right now that 's something i can only dream about . i 'll never hit it like he does and i have to make up for that somewhere else . but i 'm looking forward to getting in the heat of the moment with him in the near future and testing our games . ' how on earth did golf get this lucky ? a sport with a fuddy-duddy , middle-aged image ? consider this : the world 's top two players have an average age seven years younger than the top two in tennis . the game is very fortunate to have a man like mcilroy . it is doubly lucky to have a personable 17-year-old in lydia ko at the top of the women 's game . now spieth has come along and golf feels truly blessed . spieth pictured in his younger days playing basketball left-handed . it was with good reason that one of our competitors declared on the eve of the masters that english golf had reached the end of an era , with no players ranked in the world 's top 10 for the first time at a major since 2008 . but , following the encouraging events at augusta , there should be good days ahead . three players ranked in the top six was as many as the host nation , with ian poulter and paul casey -lrb- tied sixth -rrb- doing enough to suggest they will win at least once each before this season is out . as for joint runner-up justin rose , whose 14-under-par total would have won 74 out of 79 masters , here 's a prediction : over the next five years he will add at least one more major to his 2013 us open win . england 's justin rose on the 18th green on sunday after finishing tied for second on 14-under-par . driving . no contest here . it 's the strongest part of mcilroy 's game and the weakest part of spieth 's . mcilroy 10/10 . spieth 5/10 . iron play . mcilroy again has the edge , and particularly with the longer irons . mcilroy 8 . spieth 7 . rory mcilroy watches his tee shot on the 12th hole during the final round of the masters . chipping . mcilroy 's good in this area but spieth is brilliant , with perfect technique and great imagination . mcilroy 7 . spieth 9 . putting . when he putts well , mcilroy wins . but spieth always putts well . mcilroy 7 . spieth 9 . spieth -lrb- right -rrb- putts on the 13th green before storming to victory at augusta . mental strength . nothing to separate them in this area . both top-notch . mcilroy 9 . spieth 9 . verdict . mcilroy 41/50 . spieth 39/50 . it 's still mcilroy for me but we have to remember he is four years older , and spieth has been a pro for less than two years . the exciting thing for the game , and the frightening thing for everyone else , is they 're both so young in golf terms and clearly only going to get better in years to come . mcilroy acknowledges the crowd as his bid for a first masters title ends this year .
